# Wine-Quality-Prediction
Introduction
This project aims to predict the quality of wines based on various chemical properties and attributes. Wine quality assessment is crucial for both wine producers and consumers, as it can help identify high-quality wines and optimize production processes. In this repository, we provide a comprehensive solution for wine quality prediction using machine learning techniques.

Dataset
We have used the "Wine Quality" dataset for this project. This dataset contains red and white wine samples, each with various chemical properties and a quality rating. The dataset can be found in the data directory. The dataset is divided into two separate CSV files: winequality-red.csv for red wine samples and winequality-white.csv for white wine samples.

Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset files.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, and modeling.
src/: Python source code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
requirements.txt: List of Python packages required to run this project.
